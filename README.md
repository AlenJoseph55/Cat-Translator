### Project Description
This project is a fun web application that "translates" cat meows into human language. When users activate the microphone, it listens for meow sounds and responds with randomly selected humorous "translations", while displaying an animated cat avatar that changes moods and shows sparkle effects during the translation process.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What is my cat trying to tell me?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project turns the age-old question "What is my cat trying to tell me?" into a playful interactive experience. Instead of just wondering what your cat's meows mean, the app creates an engaging way to "decode" their messages through a whimsical AI translator, complete with mood animations and sparkly effects. While it's not actually translating cat language, it makes the common experience of talking to your pet more entertaining and shareable.
